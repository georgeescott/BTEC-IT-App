The Richard Huish College BTEC IT App has been created for students who are considering taking the BTEC IT course at Richard Huish College. It provides them with some hands-on experience working with the markup, styling and programming languages that they will learn and use throughout the course.

This app is programmed using the web technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript which can then be packaged into an app using Adobe's [Phonegap Framework](http://phonegap.com). The app allows you to access information about the course as well as interactive examples that teach you some basic principles of web development.

It was first developed and is maintained by the former Richard Huish College Student George Escott who studied BTEC Information Technology Level 3 Diploma and applied what he'd learnt to help future students. George studied the course for 2 years and achieved a Double Distinction Star (D\*D\*) and was one of the first students at Richard Huish to take the Microsoft Technology Associate exam, which he successfully passed.
