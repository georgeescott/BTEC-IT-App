						<h1>Course Structure</h1>
                        <p>
							If you want to prepare for work and study in the fast-moving technology sector or are keen to develop strong IT knowledge and skills that are valued in any industry, then a BTEC in IT is the right choice for you.
							<br/><br/>
							BTEC courses are vocational qualifications that provide an alternative method in which to gain the essential skills and knowledge for future study or a career in Information Technology. They offer you the chance to gain a nationally recognised qualification on a more practical level in the way that you are both taught and assessed. BTEC IT courses we offer:
							<br/><br/>

							<strong>Extended Diploma in IT (Software Development)</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							Broadly equivalent to 3 A Levels. This is a two year course that is typically chosen by students planning to enter a career in IT or study Computing and IT at university.
							<br/><br/>
							Students on the Extended Diploma also currently have an opportunity to take a professional exam to become a Microsoft Technology Associate.
							<br/><br/>

							<strong>Subsidiary Diploma in IT</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							Broadly equivalent to 1 A Level. In the first year you will work towards completing a BTEC National Level 3 Certificate in Information Technology.
							<br/><br/>
							Should you wish to continue with this qualification in the second year you will then work towards completing a BTEC National Level 3 Subsidiary Diploma in Information Technology.
							<br/>

						<h1>Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
						<br>

						<h6>Can I study BTEC IT without a GCSE in IT?</h6>
						<p>Yes, the course assumes no prior knowledge.</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<h6>How is the course assessed?</h6>
						<p>There are no exams, only coursework. Assignments can be in written form, but it is just as likely they will be in other forms such as videos, presentations, website designs, databases, podcasts, programming, or blog.</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<h6>Can I take BTEC IT and Computing A level at the same time?</h6>
						<p>No. Even though they are different courses, they share many topics and taking both would not be effective use of your time.</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<h6>Are BTECs recognised by universities?</h6>
						<p>Yes. Learners who gain a BTEC Level 3 National qualification will earn UCAS points at the same time and this qualification gives UCAS points equivalent to one AS level, one A level or three A levels, depending on pathway taken.</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<h6>Will I have to study other subjects as well as a BTEC?</h6>
						<p>It depends: If you are choosing to study a 1 A level equivalent qualification (Certificate and/or a Subsidiary Diploma) then yes; these qualifications will make up one of your subject choices alongside your A Levels. If you are choosing the 3 A Level equivalent qualification (Extended Diploma) then no; however, you might want to think about an additional AS Level that might strengthen your academic profile and complement your BTEC qualification.</p>

						<h1>Example 1 - HTML</h1>
						<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the computer language used for the content you see on a web page. It consists of code called tags. There are many HTML tags, some examples would be: bold text, paragraphs, headings, sections and footers. Tags look like this:</p><br>
						<code>
							&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; <span style="color: #424242;">(bold)</span><br/>
							&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; <span style="color: #424242;">(paragraph)</span><br/>
                            	&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; <span style="color: #424242;">(italics)</span><br/>
							&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; <span style="color: #424242;">(heading)</span><br/>
							&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; <span style="color: #424242;">(underline)</span><br/>
						</code>
						<p>
							To begin an HTML tag, you need to enclose it in < > symbols, with the tags name/letter inside. To end an HTML tag you do the same as opening it, but insert a / forward slash before the name of the tag. Any content you want, goes inbetween the two starting and ending tags.
							<br/><br/>
							For example for the title above we did <br/>
							<code>
								<strong>&lt;h1&gt;Example 1 - HTML&lt;/h1&gt;</strong>
							</code>
							
							Try it yourself below by adding tags around the text to make it bold then clicking the button to view it:
						</p><br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>HTML:</h5>
								<textarea>am i bold text yet?</textarea>
								<button class="html">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset">Reset</button>
							</span>

							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>Output:</h5>
								<iframe></iframe>
							</span>
						</div>

						<p>
							If you've done it right you should see that the text is now bold!<br/><br/>
							Note that many of these tags are no longer used, but learning them is useful. Styling such as underline is now done with CSS (see later examples).
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="example2">
						<h1>Example 2 - HTML</h1>
						<p>Now that you've completed the first HTML example, you can go onto something a little harder! Below is an example of a heading and then a sentence with an emphasise tag to make it italics, but something is wrong with the code!</p>
						<br/>
						
						<code>
							&lt;h1&gt;My Title&lt;/h&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
							&lt;m&gt;This is a very interesting paragraph of random text about cakes, cats, bubbles, cheese, buttercups, chocolate, glasses and sandles.&lt;em&gt;
						</code>

						<p>See if you can add the tags below, and fix the problem! Click the button to test your code:</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>HTML:</h5>
								<textarea>&lt;h1&gt;My Title&lt;/h&gt;<br/>
&lt;m&gt;This is a very interesting paragraph of random text about cakes, cats, bubbles, cheese, buttercups, chocolate, glasses and sandles.&lt;em&gt;</textarea>
								<button class="html">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset">Reset</button>
							</span>

							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>Output:</h5>
								<iframe></iframe>
							</span>
						</div>

						<p>If you've done it right you should see a header and a sentence in italics! It should look like this:</p>
						<br/><br/>
						<h1 style="color: #424242;">My Title</h1>
                        <em style="color: #424242;">This is a very interesting paragraph of random text about cakes, cats, bubbles, cheese, buttercups, chocolate, glasses and sandles.</em>

					<section id="example3">
						<h1>Example 3 - JavaScript</h1>
						<p>Javascript is a programming language used for interactivity and other functionality of a web page. It allows you do add/delete/move/change a web page and much much more! Below is an example of a simple piece of JavaScript which will write a piece of text to the page:</p><br/>
						<code>document.write("hey this really works!");</code>
						<p>the "document" is just another word for the web page, ".write" is a function in JavaScript which will write whatever is in the brackets to the document; in this case, some text. Have a go at doing the same, write your javascript in the textarea below:</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>JavaScript:</h5>
								<textarea></textarea>
								<button class="js">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset">Reset</button>
							</span>

							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>Output:</h5>
								<iframe></iframe>
							</span>
						</div>
						<p>Did you write some text to the page?</p>
					</section>

					<section id="example4">
						<h1>Example 4 - JavaScript</h1>
						<p>Now that you've completed the first Javascript example, you can go onto something harder! Below is an example of a For Loop. A for loop is very useful and time saving. If you wanted to write the 5 times table using javascript you might try and code it like this:</p><br>
						<code>
							document.write(5*1 + "&lt;br&gt;");<br> 
							document.write(5*2 + "&lt;br&gt;");<br>
							document.write(5*3 + "&lt;br&gt;");<br>
							document.write(5*4 + "&lt;br&gt;");<br>
							document.write(5*5 + "&lt;br&gt;");<br>
							document.write(5*6 + "&lt;br&gt;");
						</code>
						<p>But that takes a long time, and will make your code very long. Instead, you can use a for loop to loop through the 5 times table, adding 1 to the number 5 is being multiplied by. For example:</p>
						<code>for (var i=1; i&lt;=10; i++){<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("5 x " + i + " = " + 5*i + "&lt;br/&gt;");<br/>}</code>
						<p>
							The word "var" simply means "new variable", somewhere where we are telling the computer to store a value.
							<br/><br/>
							In this case, the variable "i". which has been set to 1 so that the loop will start with 1x5. "i<=10" means that the loop should stop at 10x5, and i++ means add one every time it loops.
							<br/><br/>
							Change the code below to make the 7 times tables, going upto 12x7.
						</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>JavaScript:</h5>
								<textarea>for (var i=1; i&lt;=10; i++){&#10;    document.write("5 x " + i + " = " + 5*i + "<br>");&#10;}</textarea>
								<button class="js">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset">Reset</button>
							</span>

							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>Output:</h5>
								<iframe></iframe>
							</span>
						</div>
						<p>did you manage to loop the 7 times table going upto 15x7?</p>
					</section>

					<section id="example5">
						<h1>Example 5 - CSS</h1>
						<p>CSS (cascading style sheet) is what styles a web page. You can change the appearance, layout and size of a web page. With CSS, you have to first select the html tag that you want to style. You then use two { } curly brackets to put the styles in. Below is an example of how you'd change the color of text on a web page:</p><br/>
						<code>html {color: red;}</code>
						<p>When using colours in CSS, you can use the name of the colour like above, or a hex colour code, which is made up of 6 digits; for example, white in hex is #FFFFFF and black is #000000. Have a go below at changing the color of the text!</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>CSS:</h5>
								<textarea></textarea>
								<button class="css">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset">Reset</button>
							</span>

							<span class="grid-6">
								<h5>Output:</h5>
								<iframe></iframe>
							</span>
						</div>
						<p>Try different colours, or even hex values!</p>
					</section>

					<section id="example6">
						<h1>Example 6 - CSS</h1>
						<p>Now that you've got the hang of that, you're ready to have a bit of fun and you can style the app with CSS! Below is the CSS to change a webpages background colour to blue.</p><br/>
						<code>html {background-color: blue;}</code>
						<p>Have a go at coding this yourself, see the app change based on the CSS you enter! Try changing the color of the text like you did in the previous CSS example!</p>
						<br/><br/>

						<div class="row">
							<span class="grid-12">
								<h5>CSS:</h5>
								<textarea></textarea>
								<button class="css-app">Test Your Code</button>
								<button class="reset-app">Reset</button>
							</span>
						</div>
						<p>pretty cool huh? research other CSS styles you can apply!</p>
