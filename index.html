						<br/><br/>
						You can open the menu to visit other parts of the app by pressing the menu icon in the top left corner of the app, or you can swipe from left to right quickly to open it. In the menu you have sever options, the first 4 options provide you with information on the course and the college.

					<h6>Course Examples</h6>
					<article class="row gutter">
						<img class="grid-3" src="img/screenshot-css.jpg"/>
						<p class="grid-6">When you click on an example from the menu, you will be greeted with a page that explains how to write code. The examples will cover step-by-step instructions on how each bit of code has a specific purpose and will teach you basic coding principles that you will learn during the course.

						<br/><br/>

						You then have input boxes for each example that will allow you to enter in your own code and display it within the app. When you have finished coding, you can press the "Test Your Code" button and it will be output on screen. You can also reset the input box if you want to start again. This learning environment will let you try out new code and advance your skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - the languages used for web development.</p>
